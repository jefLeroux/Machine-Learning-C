**important note** everything discussed in this first part is done in a way to make it easy to understand and not all the most efficient way

In [perceptron](perceptron.md) I take a look at the most basic machine learning model you can create, a single neuron. I use this single neuron to model a linear regression, and some basic logic gates. At the end I run into a problem when trying to model the [XOR](XOR.md) gate.
